# THREE track-specific profiles built from the same real facts but framed for
# their track. The scorer routes each job to the matching profile (see
# scorer.py), so a Data Scientist job is judged against the DS-framed CV, an ML
# job against the ML-framed CV, etc. — this stops the pipeline treating every
# role as "a stretch for an AI person" and is what lifts DS/ML scores.
# Human-readable copies live in cv/CV_*.md for use when actually applying.

# Facts shared verbatim across all three (single source of truth for scoring
# guardrails: language, location, work authorization, availability).

Target roles: Junior Data Scientist, Data Scientist, Associate Data Scientist, Data Analyst,
Business Intelligence Analyst, Analytics Engineer, Quantitative Analyst, Working Student is NOT
applicable (graduate).

Profile: Data-focused Computer Engineering graduate with strong statistical and
experimentation grounding. Comfortable across the full analysis loop — hypothesis, study
design, cross-validation, metric evaluation, and reproducible reporting — with SQL, Python,
and Google-certified data-analytics tooling (Tableau, regression, statistics).

Key Projects (data-science framing):
- Reproducibility Audit & Extension of CSRBoost (thesis, solo): rigorous statistical study of
  an IEEE Access 2025 paper across 15 datasets under a 100-fold evaluation protocol; only
  42/143 metric cells reproduced as published, so reverse-engineered the true per-method
  protocol over ~75,000 configurations to reach 143/143, then designed a novel extension that
  outperformed the published method on 12/15 datasets. Deep work in evaluation methodology,
  metric integrity, imbalanced-data statistics, and experimental design.
- FUS Recommender System Replication (4-author team): replicated an IEEE Access 2026 paper on
  MovieLens 100k under 10-fold cross-validation; owned the collaborative-filtering and FUS
  implementations; reproduced the headline ranking and matched MAE to four decimals
  (0.7025 vs 0.703). Recommender systems, offline evaluation, statistical validation.
- HalluScope, LLM evaluation (5-author team): quantitative evaluation study — computed
  per-sentence Shannon entropy over model outputs and matched published values to ~0.02 nats
  across 9 model-dataset cells. Measurement, metrics, statistical comparison.
- Job Hunter (solo): Python + SQL data pipeline that ingests, dedups, scores and ranks
  50–100 job postings/day and reports analytics on the funnel.

Technical Skills (data-science emphasis):
- Analysis & Statistics: hypothesis testing, regression, cross-validation, experiment design,
  A/B-style evaluation, imbalanced-data methods, metric design.
- Languages & Data: Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Tableau (Google Advanced Data
  Analytics), Jupyter.
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn, classification, regression,
  recommender systems, model evaluation.
- Also: PyTorch/TensorFlow, LLMs, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions CI/CD.

XGBoost, containerized with Docker and automated with GitHub Actions.

Key Projects (ML framing):
- Reproducibility Audit & Extension of CSRBoost (thesis, solo): reverse-engineered an
  undocumented ML evaluation protocol across 15 datasets, 10 algorithms and ~75,000
